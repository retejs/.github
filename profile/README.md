About Rete.js
----

Rete.js is a TypeScript-first framework for creating visual programming interfaces. It provides out-of-the-box solutions for visualization using various libraries and frameworks, as well as solutions for processing graphs based on dataflow and control flow approaches.

Our primary goal is to provide solutions that enable you to create flexible and user-friendly products while seamlessly bridging the gap between textual and visual programming through [code generation](https://studio.retejs.org/) and elevating visual programming to a new level by incorporating approaches such as [3D embedding](https://retejs.org/examples/3d).



Getting started
----

Use [Rete Kit](https://retejs.org/docs/development/rete-kit) to quickly set up a Rete.js application. It lets you select a stack (React.js, Vue.js, Angular or Svelte) and the set of features

```bash
npx rete-kit app
```

Alternatively, you can follow the [complete guide](https://retejs.org/docs/getting-started/)
